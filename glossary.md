### Below are commonly used terms to familiarize yourself with.


      
&nbsp;
  

  
- Reads
  
  a read is an inferred sequence of base pairs of parts of a genome
  

&nbsp;

- Variants
  
   a term often used in place of mutation


&nbsp;

- Illumina Miseq

   "The MiSeq is an integrated instrument that performs clonal amplification, genomic DNA sequencing, and data analysis with base calling, alignment, variant calling, and reporting in a single run."
   [illumina miseq](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/miseq.html)
   
 &nbsp; 
 
- Next Generation Sequencing

    a term describing new sequencing methods that are faster and more accurate than the original [Sanger sequencing](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biology/sanger-sequencing.html#:~:text=Sanger%20sequencing%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20name%20the%20Sanger%20Sequence.) technique.
    
 &nbsp;   
 
- Illumina adapter

    Illumina adapters are complementary sequences that allow the DNA fragments to bind to the flow cell. They are normally 10 bp long
    
&nbsp;

- Reference sequence
  
    An similar, but already sequenced genome used as a template to compare the genome in question to.
    For example, the CHIKV virus genome.
    
 &nbsp; 
 
- Primer
    
    " A primer is a short nucleic acid sequence that provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. In living organisms, primers are short strands of RNA. A primer must be              synthesized by an enzyme called primase, which is a type of RNA polymerase, before DNA replication can occur."
     [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/primer-305/)
     
&nbsp;

- .fastq

    Each piece of DNA is sequenced twice, starting from either end (Paired end sequencing). The products of a sequencing run are called “reads.” The sequence and quality information are stored in .fastq files

&nbsp;

- Fast QC
  
    provides a numerical score to the quality of each read to give an impression of whether there are any issues with your data before you begin further analysis.

&nbsp;    

- Library
    
    A pool of DNA to be sequenced
    
&nbsp;    

- Read trimming

    Removing low quality reads, adapters and primers
    
&nbsp;

- bwa
    
   [Burrows-Wheeler Aligner](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
   "BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome,     such as the human genome"
   
&nbsp;    

- **velvet

&nbsp;

- QUAST

  [Quality Assessment Tool](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast)
  A program used to compare the preliminary assembly to a known genome of the same species.           
  Identifies functional sequences like genes and RNAs.
  
 &nbsp; 
 
- contigs

  a set of overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA
  
 &nbsp; 
 
- consensus
  
     the most common nucleotides found at a specific location in DNA or RNA
 
&nbsp;

- mafft
    
  [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) (for multiple alignment using fast Fourier       transform) is a multiple sequence alignment program
  
&nbsp;  

- polish
 
    identifying and correcting positions where the read sequences differ from the draft genome
    
&nbsp;    

- position
     
     location of a nucleotide on a sequence, deliniated by a position number
   
&nbsp; 

- Haplotype

     A region of DNA inherited from the parent. For viruses, the haplotype is the full genome.
  
&nbsp; 

- Haplotype network
 
   An arrangement of the genomes where each genome is connected by a line to the genomes it is most    similar to. This allows us to visually depict the differences between several genomes.
   
&nbsp;

- S, SP, SB
   
   In this example, S : survivor, SP : survivor's partner, SB : survivor's brother
